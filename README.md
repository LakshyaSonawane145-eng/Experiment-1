Aim : Introduction to Python 

Theory : 
->Python supports multiple data types such as integer, float, string, list,and boolean, allowing storage and manipulation of different kinds of data.
->Python is a dynamically typed language, so the data type of a variable is automatically determined at runtime.
->These data types help in writing flexible, readable, and efficient programs.
->The math package in Python provides built-in mathematical functions and constants for performing advanced calculations. It includes functions for arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and rounding operations.
->The math package improves accuracy and simplifies complex mathematical computations.


Algorithm: Using Multiple Data Types and Math Package in Python

Start the program.

Declare variables of different data types such as integer, float, string, and list.

Assign appropriate values to the variables.

Import the math package using import math.

Perform mathematical operations using math functions (like square root or power).

Display the results and stop the program.

Conclusion:
Python’s support for multiple data types makes it easy to handle different kinds of data efficiently within a program. The math package further enhances Python by providing accurate and ready-to-use mathematical functions. 
Together, they make Python powerful and suitable for scientific and general-purpose programming.
