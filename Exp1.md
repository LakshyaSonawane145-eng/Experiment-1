Aim : Introduction to Python 

Theory : 
->Python supports multiple data types such as integer, float, string, list,and boolean, allowing storage and manipulation of different kinds of data.
->In python we can calculate the Area of the circle using the math package 
->We can create mini calculator by using arithmetic operations and taking input from user
->These data types help in writing flexible, readable, and efficient programs.
->The math package in Python provides built-in mathematical functions and constants for performing advanced calculations. It includes functions for arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and rounding operations.
->The math package improves accuracy and simplifies complex mathematical computations.


Algorithm: 

Start the program.

Declare variables of different data types such as integer and float.

Accept two numbers from the user and perform a mini calculator operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,exponential)==>(a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b, a**b)

Compare the two numbers using if–else statement and display which number is greater or if they are equal.

Import the math package using import math.

Calculate the area of a circle using the formula πr² with math.pi.

Find and display different trigonometric values such as sine, cosine, and tangent using the math package.

Calculate and display logarithmic values using log functions from the math package.

Display all results.

Stop the program.

Conclusion:
Python’s support for multiple data types makes it easy to handle different kinds of data efficiently within a program. The math package further enhances Python by providing accurate and ready-to-use mathematical functions. 
Together, they make Python powerful and suitable for scientific and general-purpose programming.This program demonstrates the use of multiple data types along with conditional statements like if–else for decision making.
It also shows how the math package simplifies calculations such as area of a circle, trigonometric, and logarithmic values. Overall, it helps in understanding basic programming logic and mathematical operations in Python.
